		/// The TARGET_SIMULATOR property can have a value of XSim, ModelSim, IES, Xcelium, VCS,

		/// The target simulator can also be defined from the Vivado IDE. Create or open a project, select
		/// Tools → Settings → Simulation menu item, and select the Target simulator from the drop-down
		/// menu. The available choices are: Vivado simulator, ModelSim Simulator, Questa Advanced
		/// Simulator, Incisive Enterprise Simulator (IES), Xcelium Parallel Simulator, Verilog Compiler
		/// Simulator (VCS), Riviera-PRO Simulator, and Active-HDL Simulator.
		/// TIP: Some of these simulators are only available on Linux and some are only available on Windows.
		/// The launch_simulation command uses a three-step process comprised of compile,
		/// elaborate, and simulate steps. A script file for the target simulator is created for each step in the
		/// process, (compile.bat, elaborate.bat, simulate.bat), and written to the simulation run
		/// directory.
		/// TIP: On Linux the script files are named with the .sh suffix instead of .bat.
		/// By default, launch_simulation will run these script files in sequence to run the simulation.
		/// You can create the scripts without running them by using the -scripts_only option.
		/// This command returns a transcript of its process, or returns an error if it fails.
