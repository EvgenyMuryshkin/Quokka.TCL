		/// 2. Program the FPGA with the bitstream (.bit) and probes (.ltx) files using

		/// You set these properties with the set_property command. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite
		/// User Guide: Vivado Programming and Debugging (UG908) for more information on setting
		/// properties to configure debug cores and signal probes to monitor the design.
		/// RECOMMENDED: The Vivado IDE provides a graphical interface to configure hw_ila and hw_probes for trigger
		/// and capture. You can use the Vivado IDE to see the properties needed to configure and run the hw_ila.
		/// The specific properties on the hw_ila you can use to configure a debug core include the
		/// following:
		/// â¢ CONTROL.DATA_DEPTH - Defaults to the MAX_DATA_DEPTH of the ILA debug core, which
		/// was set when the debug core was created or inserted into the design. The data depth defines
		/// the number of data samples the hw_ila object can capture in a data window. Set the data
		/// depth as an integer which is a power of two, from 1 to the maximum data depth
		/// (MAX_DATA_DEPTH) of the hw_ila.
		/// Note: The value of DATA_DEPTH is related to CONTROL.WINDOW_COUNT by the equation:
		/// DATA_DEPTH * WINDOW_COUNT = MAX_DATA_DEPTH
		/// â¢ CONTROL.WINDOW_COUNT - Lets you divide the MAX_DATA_DEPTH of the ILA core into
		/// a number of data windows to store sample data from multiple trigger events. In the case of 10
		/// data windows for example, the first window will be filled at the first trigger event, and each
		/// subsequent window will be filled upon subsequent triggering events or capture conditions.
		/// â¢ CONTROL.TRIGGER_POSITION - An integer value related to the DATA_DEPTH. Positions the
		/// trigger event in the sample data buffer. For a DATA_DEPTH of 1024, position 0 refers to the
		/// first (or left-most) data buffer and 1023 refers to the last (or right-most) data buffer. The
		/// TRIGGER_POSITION lets you capture sample data ahead of the trigger event. For instance,
		/// with a DATA_DEPTH of 256, a TRIGGER_POSITION of 100 allows you to capture 100 data
		/// samples ahead of the trigger, and 155 data samples at and after the trigger event.
		/// Note: In the case of run_hw_ila -trigger_now 1, the TRIGGER_POSITION merely positions the
		/// trigger mark in the Vivado logic analyzer waveform window. Because the trigger event is immediate,
		/// there is no time to capture data samples ahead of the trigger.
		/// â¢ CONTROL.TRIGGER_MODE - Valid values include:
		/// â BASIC_ONLY - The trigger condition is the result of a Boolean equation using the
		/// TRIGGER_CONDITION to evaluate the values on each of the associated ILA probes.
		/// â BASIC_OR_TRIG_IN - The ILA core is triggered by a Boolean equation considering probe
		/// values, or by the TRIG_IN port on the core.
		/// â ADVANCED_ONLY - The ILA core is configured to have advanced trigger capabilities

		/// on the core.
		/// â TRIG_IN_ONLY - The ILA core is triggered only by the TRIG_IN port on the core.
		/// â¢ CONTROL.TRIGGER_CONDITION - Defines a Boolean equation which evaluates comparators
		/// on participating probes on the ILA debug core. When the condition evaluates to true, the
		/// BASIC trigger mode is satisfied. Valid values include:
		/// â AND - Trigger condition is "true" if all participating probe comparators evaluate "true",
		/// otherwise trigger condition is "false".
		/// â NAND - Trigger condition is "true" if at least one participating probe comparator evaluates
		/// "false", otherwise trigger condition is "false".

		/// â NOR - Trigger condition is "true" if all participating probe comparators evaluate "false",

		/// Note: The evaluation of the probes participating in the trigger condition is determined by the
		/// TRIGGER_COMPARE_VALUE property assigned to the hw_probe object, as returned by
		/// get_hw_probes. If the TRIGGER_COMPARE_VALUE is 'X' then it is not participating in the trigger
		/// condition.
		/// â¢ CONTROL.TSM_FILE - Specify the path to a file defining a Trigger Finite State Machine (TSM)
		/// to be used for advanced trigger handling.
		/// â¢ CONTROL.TRIG_OUT_MODE - Used to transition the TRIG_OUT port on the ILA core to be
		/// used to drive the TRIG_IN port on other ILA cores. Valid values include:
		/// â DISABLED - Disable the TRIG_OUT port on the ILA core.
		/// â TRIGGER_ONLY - Transition the TRIG_OUT port when the trigger conditions have been

		/// â TRIG_IN_ONLY - Transition the TRIG_OUT when the TRIG_IN signal transitions. Use this to

		/// â TRIGGER_OR_TRIG_IN - Transition the TRIG_OUT when either the trigger conditions are

		/// â¢ CONTROL.CAPTURE_MODE - Valid values include ALWAYS or BASIC. Capture and store a

		/// Generate SVF file for current_hw_target
		///
		/// The Vivado hardware manager supports programming of hardware devices through the use of
		/// Serial Vector Format (SVF) files. SVF files are ASCII files that contain both programming
		/// instructions and configuration data. These files are used by ATE machines and embedded
		/// controllers to perform boundary-scan operations. The SVF file captures the JTAG commands
		/// needed to program the bitstream directly into a Xilinx device, or indirectly into a flash memory
		/// device. The SVF file can be written using the write_hw_svf command, or applied to an open
		/// hw_target through the execute_hw_svf command. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide:
		/// Programming and Debugging (UG908) for more information.
		/// The specific process for creating the hw_svf file is:
		/// 1. Create an SVF target using create_hw_target.
		/// 2. Open the SVF target.
		/// 3. Create one or more devices on the SVF target using create_hw_device.
		/// 4. Program the devices using commands like program_hw_devices.
		/// 5. Write the SVF file of operation commands using write_hw_svf.
		/// In programming the hw_devices in Step 4 above, the SVF commands for the operations are
		/// cached to a temporary file. The write_hw_svf command saves the cache by giving it a file
		/// name and moving it to the specified file path.
		/// Note: Because this command is essentially flushing the cached SVF commands, after you use the
		/// write_hw_svf command, the cache is cleared, and restarted to capture any new device commands.
		/// This command returns a message indicating success, or returns an error if it fails.
		///
		/// The following example writes an SVF file to specified location:
		/// program_hw_devices [lindex [get_hw_devices] 0]
		/// write_hw_svf C:/Data/k7_design.svf
		/// This example demonstrates the correct order of creating multiple devices on an SVF target. An
		/// SVF target is created and opened, then a Xilinx device, a user part, and a second Xilinx device are
		/// created on the current target. The bitstream properties are defined for the two Xilinx devices, the
		/// devices are programmed, and an SVF file is written:
		/// open_hw
		/// connect_hw_server
		/// create_hw_target my_svf_target
		/// open_hw_target
		/// create_hw_device -part xc7k325t
